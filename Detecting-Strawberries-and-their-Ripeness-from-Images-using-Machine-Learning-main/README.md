# Strawberry Counting and Ripeness Detection

This repository contains the project report for the Computer Vision Group 6 project titled “Strawberry Counting and Ripeness Detection,” conducted by myself and 2 other students from Trinity College Dublin. The project explores the application of computer vision techniques to automate the process of counting strawberries and assessing their ripeness.

Key Features:
Automated Counting: Utilizes YOLO v7 for efficient object detection to count strawberries in images.
Ripeness Detection: Implements various approaches, including color analysis and texture analysis, to determine the ripeness level of strawberries.
Experimental Results: Provides experimental results demonstrating high accuracy in strawberry counting and ripeness detection.
